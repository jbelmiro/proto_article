Layer,Description
Layer 1,"Reddish dark brown silt/clay matrix sediment, with a granulous texture, possibly disturbed by agricultural processes; ceramics until 30 cm depth, immediately above the transition between layer 1 and 2."
Layer 2,"Dark sediment, more compact and with a heavier clay-like component; has a thickness of 25-30 cm and is well preserved; bones and ceramics are often in connection, with restricted spatial distributions; the limestone blocks correlate with the antropical structures dug in 2004; where the level with a Neolithic occupation has been identified."
Layer 3,"Silt and clay matrix sediment, with some inclusions, mostly small limestone clasts; this layer is often interrupted by the deposition of levels of clasts with different sizes; presence of lithic artefacts and fauna is constant in all of the deposit, though it is possible to identify two different cultural horizons: Epipaleolithic (3A) and Solutrean (3B)."
Layer 4,"Identical to layer 3 but separated by the presence of a gravel level; contains sedimentary lateral variations, marked by different intensity of sediment compactation and/or concentration of organic materials (4B, 4C, 4D, 4E); identified two different cultural horizons of Solutrean and Proto-Solutrean chronology."
Layer 5,"Silt and clay matrix sediment with a heavy presence of organic elements, such as small, medium and large faunal remains (frequently calcinated), which gives this layer a dark color."
Layer 6,"Silt and clay matrix sediment with a heavy presence of organic elements, such as small, medium and large faunal remains (frequently calcinated), which gives this layer a dark color; presence of bigger quantity of small and medium sized limestone clasts."
